# Basics of SQL
- Database: structure data just like a spreadsheet, by organizing data in different tables comprised of rows and columns.
- A database can store much more data more securely than a spreadsheet or a text file. In order to "ask" for data from the database we need to write queries.
- Column names are metadata.
- The semicolon indicates that we have reached the end of the query.
